## Description
Randomly generate two pokémons and declare a winner!
We are using HTML5, CSS, and Javascript to fetch data from an open API source of pokémons.

As of right now, the win conditions of a pokémon is simply who has a higher attack value. However, we would like to implement 
a more complex and detailed condition that determines a winner based not only on their attack value but also their defense, type, special-attack, special-defense, and speed stats.

We would also like to achieve a responsive design where the it would be suitable for use in a desktop, tablet, and mobile phone.
